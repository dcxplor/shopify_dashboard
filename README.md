A dynamic Power BI dashboard built to analyze Shopify sales data—focusing on transaction performance, customer purchase patterns, and long-term retention value.

By turning raw Shopify data into actionable insights, this dashboard enables data-driven decisions to optimize revenue, improve marketing strategies, and boost customer loyalty.
Tech Stack

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for data visualization and dashboard development.
📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation layer.
🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic visuals.
🏗 Data Modeling – Relationships built across transactions, customers, and product datasets.
📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for visual dashboard previews.
Data Source
Source: Shopify transactional data.
Transaction data: Net Sales, Quantity, Order Values.
Customer data: Total customers, first-time vs repeat buyers, purchase frequency, LTV.
Product data: Product types, sales volume, and order distribution.
Payment data: Gateway methods usage and popularity.
Location data: Province and city-level sales/customer performance.
Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
E-commerce companies often struggle to identify which regions, products, and customer segments are driving growth. Raw transactional data does not easily reveal retention trends, sales peaks, or product performance without advanced analytics.
• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive Shopify analytics tool that:
Tracks net sales, order volume, and AOV over time.
Highlights customer behavior trends (first-time vs repeat buyers).
Analyzes retention and lifetime value (LTV).
Identifies best-performing products, payment methods, and regions.
Supports decisions around marketing strategy, product mix, and regional expansion.
